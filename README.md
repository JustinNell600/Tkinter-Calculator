# 🧮 Tkinter Calculator

A lightweight and user-friendly **desktop calculator** built using **Python** and **Tkinter**. This project aim was for me to learn tkinter to start developing python programs with tkinter GUI's.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Ensure **Python 3.x** is installed
2. Install Tkinter if your distribution does not include it
3. Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```
## 🌱 Future Plans
1. Plans to work with <a href="https://github.com/ParthJadhav/Tkinter-Designer">tkinter designer</a> to create more visually appealing gui and potentially play around with customizable themes are in the making
2. Incorporate more calculations than the basic, essentially creating a normal physical scientific calculator but on a virtual front
3. Clean the code a bit more to increase efficiency and readability
